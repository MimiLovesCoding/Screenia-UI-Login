💻 <b>Automated and Manual Software Testing</b>
<br>
<br>
UI (User Interface) and User Experience (UX) test cases is a critical responsibility to ensure the software functions as expected. The process of writing and executing these test cases provides several key benefits, including early detection of defects, identification of risks related to software functionality, improved testing efficiency, and a clear roadmap for testers. 
<br>
<br>
⭐ <b>Benefits of Automated Testing</b>
<br>
✅ Automated testing can offer higher accuracy than manual testing by reducing 
   human error and ensuring consistent execution.

✅ Automated tests can be executed much faster than manual tests and can be 
   repeated as often as needed without additional costs, making them ideal for 
   regression testing.

✅  While setting up automated testing can be costly—due to software, tools, and 
    training—manual testing can be more cost-effective for smaller projects or 
    one-time tests.

⭐ <b>Benefits of Manual Testing</b>
<br>
✅  Manual testing is more adaptable and can accommodate changes quickly, while 
    automated testing is constrained to predefined scripts, making it less 
    flexible for dynamic or exploratory testing scenarios.

✅  Manual testing allows testers to leverage their intuition and experience, 
    enabling them to explore edge cases, uncover unexpected issues, and make 
    judgment calls that automated tests may miss.

✅  Manual testing can provide a deeper understanding of the user experience by 
    simulating how real users interact with the application, which is valuable 
    for assessing UI/UX nuances.

✅  Automated testing excels in running repetitive tests consistently and at 
    scale, ensuring issues that might go unnoticed in manual testing are 
    identified early.

💡 <b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
By strategically combining both manual and automated testing, QA Engineers can achieve comprehensive coverage, balance speed and flexibility, to ensure that the software delivers both functional quality and an optimal user experience.
